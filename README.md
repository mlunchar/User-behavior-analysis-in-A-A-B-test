# User-behavior-analysis-in-A-A-B-test
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course as the second Integrated project, uniting Business Analitics, A/B test analysis and Data Visualization themes.

* In this project we use Seaborn ad Plotly libraries for data visualization.
* For analyzing user behavior we create sequence of events and a Funnel for app screens. Additionally, we create a function for z-test for hypotheses testing.

Project description:

Working as a data analyst in a startup that sells food products we need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.

Project structure:

1. General look at the data.
2. Preparing the data. Dealing with missing values, duplicates, changing data types.
3. Data analysis. General data and funnel analysis. Hypotheses testing.
4. Overall conclusion and advice for business.

Additional information:
* 246 and 247 are the control groups, 248 is the test group.

* The project was created in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

* When downloaded, the data has to be stored in the same folder with the notebook.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in February 2022.
